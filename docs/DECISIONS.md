# Decision Log

## ADR-001 - Native MQL5 Production Runtime

Reason: Native MQL5 keeps infrastructure minimal, integrates directly with MT5, and is suitable for deployment on the Exness Windows VPS.

## ADR-002 - Strategy/Execution Separation

Reason: Strategies should not possess authority to bypass safety checks, risk controls, sizing rules, or broker execution boundaries.

## ADR-003 - Fail-Closed Safety

Reason: Unknown or ambiguous safety state should prevent new exposure rather than guess.

## ADR-004 - No External Runtime Initially

Reason: A single-trader retail system should remain cheap, simple, and operationally easy to run.

## ADR-005 - Broker State Is Authoritative

Reason: EA RAM state can disappear after restart, crash, recompilation, chart changes, or VPS interruption.

## ADR-006 - Canonical XAU Point Model

Reason: ScoreBot_v3 thresholds were specified in 0.01 XAUUSD price units, while brokers may quote gold with different native point sizes. Strategy thresholds use canonical points and convert to broker-native values only at MT5 boundaries.

## ADR-007 - Analysis Mode Remains Active When Trading Is Disabled

Reason: `InpEnableTrading=false` should allow safe observation of signals, scores, dashboard state, and block reasons without letting orders reach the broker.
